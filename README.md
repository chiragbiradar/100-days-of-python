# 100 Days of Python

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to my 100-day journey with the Python course by Dr. Angela Yu. My name is Chirag Biradar, and I am a passionate learner who is eager to dive deeper into the world of programming with Python.

I have decided to embark on this journey to not only improve my skills in the language but to also learn about the various applications of Python in the field of data science, machine learning, and web development. I believe that with the right guidance, effort, and dedication, anyone can master Python, and I am no exception.

The course by Dr. Angela Yu is renowned for its comprehensive and engaging approach to teaching Python. The curriculum covers a wide range of topics from the basics of programming to advanced topics such as web development, machine learning, and data visualization.

In this repository, I will be sharing my journey through this course, including my notes, code snippets, and projects. I will also be documenting my progress and the challenges I face along the way. I believe that this will not only serve as a reference for me in the future but will also inspire and motivate others who are starting on their own Python journey.

I invite you to follow along with me on this exciting journey, and I look forward to sharing my experiences with you. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's learn and grow together!
